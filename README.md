# OroraTech challenge

Creates geojson files for hotspots. The dataset paths are hardcoded in the app.py file.
The geojson files can be viewed at geojson.io

Requires the following python libraries:

- opencv
- numpy
- geojson

ToDos:

- clusters shouldn't show lines. There might be better alternatives to use than the opencv findContours algorithm for such tasks
- possibly filtering
